## üìå Overview
This repository contains two major data analytics projects completed as part of the **BUSI 653-06: Cloud Computing Technologies** course at **University Canada West**. These projects leverage AWS cloud services and data analytics techniques to provide insights and improve decision-making.

## üèÜ Projects
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Public Trees Health Monitoring System for the City of Vancouver
**Objective**: Analyze and monitor the health of public trees in Vancouver using cloud-based data analytics.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  - Identified missing values and skewed distributions.
  - Used AWS Glue DataBrew for data profiling.
  - Geospatial mapping of tree density.

- **Descriptive Analysis**
  - Summarized health trends and species distribution.
  - Ranked top 5 most common tree species.
  - Used AWS Athena for SQL-based analysis.

- **Diagnostic Analysis**
  - Investigated factors affecting tree health.
  - Correlation analysis between diameter and planting year.

- **Data Wrangling**
  - Cleaned and transformed datasets.
  - Standardized `date_planted` format.
  - Removed duplicate `TREE_ID` values.

- **Data Quality Control**
  - Validated data accuracy and completeness.
  - Monitored anomalies using AWS CloudWatch.

üîó **Project Files**:  
- `public-trees-analysis/` ‚Äì Data profiling reports, transformation scripts, SQL queries  
- `visualizations/` ‚Äì Charts, graphs, and geospatial maps  
- `data/` ‚Äì Cleaned dataset (CSV/Parquet format)
